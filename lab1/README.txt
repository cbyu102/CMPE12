How I would make a digit display:
I would start by deciding on the max number it would display. It would be
parallel to how many inputs it would take in. After that, I would make it so
that the inputs from top to bottom would match the binary inputed. After
that, I would just use that base in order to calculate the number and then
display it on the screen.

How does the random generator work:
I think it could use a complex code to transform the inputed number into a
different number. It could use any number it keeps track of. Maybe it uses
the seconds on your computer clock to calculate random number. But if it
doesn't have access to that number, maybe it uses the runtime to calculate
a random number. That way it's different every time you click on the button
to generate a random number. Also another theory is that it uses a combination
of those numbers to make something thats random. I don't think it's possible
for a machine to be completely random since everything has to be programmed
and therefore is always logical. Saying that, it is a trick that programmers
use to make people think the numbers generated are random. But it was all
a code used to mutate numbers enough so that it seems random.
