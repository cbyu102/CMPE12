Lab 2: Adding and Subtracting
Crystal Yu (cbyu@ucsc.edu) - 1539794
Due: 10/11
Section: F

Purpose:
The purpose of this lab was to continue to get used to building circuits and learn how to
add and subract in binary using circuits.

Methods:
The set up of the inputs and flip-flops were fairly straightforward given the directions in the lab. For
the addition circuit, I basically did step-by-step exactly how a person would add binary numbers. I used
the XOR Gate to "add" the two bits. Then, to make sure I carried over, I used an AND gate and inculded
that in the twos place calculation. I then just continued like that up until the last place. 

Results:
It was very experimental and I wasn't sure if it was going to work. However, when I tested it, it was able
to successully run and didn't really need any changes.

Analysis:
At first, even though I was adding numbers, nothing happened. It took me a few hours to figure out that
one of my wires was hooked to the wrong input. After that, everything worked. The only thing I didn't get to
was the subtraction. I understand that the reason the ones-place carry bit is because during subtraction,
the number would be incorrect if nothing was carried over to the ones and it went out of bounds. However,
I didn't get to subtraction because I ran out of time.
